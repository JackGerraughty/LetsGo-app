# Tamagui + Solito + Next + Expo Monorepo


## 🔦 About

## 📦 Included packages

- [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev) 🪄
- [solito](https://solito.dev) for cross-platform navigation
- Expo SDK
- Next.js
- Expo Router

## 🗂 Folder layout

The main apps are:

- `expo` (native)
- `next` (web)


## 🏁 Start the app

- to run the project run these commands: `npm install`
- `npx expo start`
- select ios version
  

- Install dependencies: `yarn`

- Next.js local dev: `yarn web`


To run with optimizer on in dev mode (just for testing, it's faster to leave it off): `yarn web:extract`. To build for production `yarn web:prod`.

To see debug output to verify the compiler, add `// debug` as a comment to the top of any file.

- Expo local dev: `yarn native`


## 🆕 Add new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

If you're installing a JavaScript-only dependency that will be used across platforms, install it in `packages/app`:

```sh
cd packages/app
yarn add date-fns
cd ../..
yarn
```

### Native dependencies

If you're installing a library with any native code, you must install it in `expo`:

```sh
cd apps/expo
yarn add react-native-reanimated
cd ..
yarn
```

## Update new dependencies

### Pure JS dependencies

```sh
yarn upgrade-interactive
```

You can also install the native library inside of `packages/app` if you want to get autoimport for that package inside of the `app` folder. However, you need to be careful and install the _exact_ same version in both packages. If the versions mismatch at all, you'll potentially get terrible bugs. This is a classic monorepo issue. I use `lerna-update-wizard` to help with this (you don't need to use Lerna to use that lib).

You may potentially want to have the native module transpiled for the next app. If you get error messages with `Cannot use import statement outside a module`, you may need to use `transpilePackages` in your `next.config.js` and add the module to the array there.

### Deploying to Vercel

- Root: `apps/next`
- Install command to be `yarn set version stable && yarn install`
- Build command: leave default setting
- Output dir: leave default setting
